# Discrete Structure and the Unification of Physics  
### Reproducible Code Repository

This repository contains reproducible numerical scripts associated with the paper:

**“Discrete Structure and the Unification of Physics”**

The purpose of this repository is to provide transparency and numerical support for
key results presented in the paper, in particular those illustrated by figures.
The code is intended to complement the analytical development, not to replace it.

## Scope of the Repository

The scripts included here focus on:

- Discrete lattice dynamics and dispersion relations  
- Emergent quantum behavior from discrete paths  
- Uncertainty relations arising from coarse-graining  
- Fermion doubling and its suppression via discrete Z₃ projection  
- Gauge dynamics from link variables and plaquettes  
- Emergent curvature and Regge-like discrete geometry  
- Discrete cosmological dynamics and bounce scenarios  
- Modified dispersion relations and potential observational signatures  

Each script is designed to be:
- minimal,
- readable,
- and directly connected to a specific result or figure in the paper.

## What This Repository Is Not

This repository does **not** aim to:

- Symbolically reproduce every analytical derivation in the paper  
- Provide a complete simulation of the full framework  
- Serve as a general-purpose physics engine  

Analytical derivations are presented in the paper itself.  
The role of the code is numerical validation, illustration, and reproducibility.


Not all scripts are required to reproduce all figures; each file is self-contained.

---

## Requirements

The scripts use standard scientific Python libraries:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

No specialized or proprietary software is required.

---

## Reproducibility

All numerical results presented in the paper that rely on explicit computation
can be reproduced using the scripts provided here, up to numerical precision
and chosen parameter values.

Figures generated by the scripts may differ slightly in visual appearance
depending on plotting parameters, but the underlying behavior is robust.

The code may be reused and modified with appropriate citation of the original work.

## Status

This repository accompanies a foundational theoretical work.
It may be extended in the future with additional scripts or refinements,
but it is not expected to evolve into a large software project.
