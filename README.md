Reproducible numerical scripts and figures associated with the paper “Discrete Structure and the Unification of Physics”.
# Discrete Structure and the Unification of Physics – Code Repository

This repository contains reproducible numerical scripts used to generate
the figures and validate key results presented in the paper:

"Discrete Structure and the Unification of Physics"

The code focuses on:
- lattice dispersion relations
- emergent quantum behavior
- Z3 fermion projection
- gauge dynamics from plaquettes
- discrete curvature and cosmology

This repository is not intended to symbolically reproduce analytical
derivations, but to provide numerical validation and transparency.
